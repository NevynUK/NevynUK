## About Me

Firmware Engineer specialising in C/C++ code running on STM32 and ESP32 microcontrollers.  Main focus is currently:

* NuttX running on STM32F777
* FreeRTOS running on ESP32

Although my main development languages are currently C and C++, I have developed in over 20 languages in the past but somehow I always find myself working in these two languages.

I also have experience designing hardware using KiCAD.

More information can be found in my [personal blog](https://blog.mark-stevens.co.uk/).

Currently living in the North of England and trying to get to grips with the needs of work and the garden. Despite appearances, I am a reluctant gardener and just move the mud around as instructed by my wife.
